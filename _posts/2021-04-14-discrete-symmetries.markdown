# Symmetry

Any individual who has taken a high school or college physics course has likely
encountered the idea of symmetry in a physics setting before. A typical example
would be in the context of mass or charge distributions, where calculations
relating to the gravitational or electric fields of uniformly massive or charged
surfaces can be greatly simplified by appealing to symmetry.

| An example of employing symmetry to simplify calculations using Gauss's Law, as any fields generated by the sphere are uniform along the surface $GS$. |

However, tricks like these tend to be ad-hoc aids for performing calculations,
and are tied to parameters (like the charge distribution) that may vary from
system to system; this begs the question &mdash; are there symmetries tied more
closely to the physical interactions that are, in some way, less sensitive to
specific configurations?

This question has significant consequences being explored today in the context of
Quantum Field Theory and high energy particle physics. However, it's easier to
start in the world of classical physics and move our way into the modern era to
understand how the picture changes as we embrace the added "machinery" that each
new theory gives us.

Our story begins with a German mathematician named Emmy Noether in 1915 who proved
a significant theorem[^1] decribing classical physics, one form of which says

> Every differentiable symmetry of a physical system's Lagrangian implies the
> conservation of some quantity with respect to time.

This theorem leads to many results that are typically covered in advanced undergraduate
physics courses. Using the theorem, it can be shown that invariance of a system's
Lagrangian under small changes in time, linear position, angular position, and
electric (scalar and vector) potential leads to the conservation of energy, momentum,
angular momentum, and charge, respectively.
But what if have symmetries that are not "smooth" in the same sense as translations
and rotations in space, and are instead confined to some discrete set of values?
We then lose Noether's Theorem, and it seems we're back to a situation where the
symmetry approach may work for some transformations, but fail for others.

## Inversions

Fortunately, three discrete transformations that challenge our recent understanding
of physics &mdash; charge conjugation, time reversal, and parity inversion &mdash;
fall under a category of transformations known as inversions (i.e. they are
self-inverses). If these transformations are symmetries, we can label each part
of a system with $-1$ or $1$ (even or odd), and the product of these labels is
in fact conserved. Since these labels can typically be associated with physical
observables, we can experimentally verify whether these symmetries are violated
by looking for lack of conservation, just like with Noether's theorem!

### Parity

Let's start by concretely thinking about the parity inversion transformation.
Mathematically, this corresponds to negating the components of all position vectors,
or, equivalently, flipping the direction of the coordinate axes. You can convince
yourself that this is the same as turning every object into its mirror image by
holding your hands out in front of you, pointing your thumbs up, your index
fingers towards each other, and your middle fingers towards yourself so that
each hand has three fingers perpendicular to each other. If you rotate your left
hand so that your thumb faces down, each corresponding finger between your left
and right hand will be pointing in opposite directions. So parity and mirror
symmetry are the same thing (up to some rotation).

In classical mechanics, the parity properties of physical quantities can be
tabulated by expressing them in terms of more basic quantities (such as $p=\dot{x}$,
which flips sign under parity inversion, since $t$ stays the same but $x$ flips).
There's no major significance for parity in classical mechanics, though the formulation
gives us our motivation for defining it in quantum mechanics.

In quantum mechanics, the parity operator $\hat{P}$ can be defined as the operator
negating the matrix element for position with respect to some wavefunction basis:

$$\langle \psi_2 | \hat{x}| \psi_1 \rangle \mapsto -\langle \psi_2 |\hat{x}|\psi_1\rangle$$

This has two identical interpretations for how we achieve this using the $\hat{P}$
operator: we either map $\hat{x}$ to $P^\dagger \hat{x} P$, or map $|\psi_1\rangle$
to $P|\psi_1\rangle$, and obtain the $P^\dagger$ from the corresponding bra. This
allows us to calculate the parity of operators acting on definite parity states.
For example, the $\hat{L}$ operator has even parity, just like the parity of
the $L=r \times p$ quantity from classical mechanics.

In quantum mechanics, parity symmetry appears in any situation where the Hamiltonian
is parity-invariant. Since the kinetic term in the Hamiltonian is always an even
function of position, it follows this condition is equivalent to the $V$ term also
being an even function of position. Think about what types of systems automatically
gain parity conservation from this alone!

### Charge

Another example of a useful discrete transformation in the quantum world is that of
charge conjugation. In the classical setting, this corresponds to negating the
electric charge distribution of any physical bodies. On a larger scale, this has
the effect of negating charges, currents, electric fields, and magnetic fields.
As a result, Maxwell's equations

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$
$$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$
$$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0(\mathbf{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t})$$

can be seen to be invariant under charge conjugation. In other words, classical
electrodynamics is fundamentally charge-symmetric. In quantum mechanics, charge
is usually a fixed parameter of the system, and there's not much we can say about
it at this point, but C-symmetry will play an important part when QFT comes into play.

### Time

Time-reversal symmetry corresponds to playing videos of physical phenomena in
reverse. Clocks tick backwards, and gravity carries balls uphill. One of the most
important ways to describe this is by realizing that odd time derivatives become
negated, while even derivatives do not. This way, both Newton's second law

\\[
    F = m\ddot{x}
\\]

and Maxwell's equations, given earlier, are invariant under time reversal. However,
the quantum mechanical picture becomes complicated &mdash; it's insufficient to
perform our earlier trick of using the correspondence principle to perform the
transformation $t \mapsto -t$. We must additionally perform the change $i \mapsto -i$.
Under the assumption that the Hamiltonian is time-independent, the Schrodinger
equation becomes time-reversal invariant[^2]. Beyond the complication of needing the
complex conjugation transformation, the result is otherwise identical to the
classical picture: T-symmetry is built into quantum mechanics.

### QFT and Beyond

The Standard Model of particle physics is built upon Quantum Field Theory, a
relativistic extension of quantum mechanics that considers the fundamental physical
entities to be quantum fields, with particles corresponding to excitations of
these fields. The three fundamental forces of nature described by the Standard
Model &mdash; the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces &mdash; are each
described by their own individual quantum field theories. During the early
development of the SM, each force was thought to be C-, P-, and T-symmetric.
However, in 1956 the Wu experiment detected parity-violation in Cobalt-60 beta
decays, meaning the weak interaction was parity-asymmetric [^3]. Afterwards, the 
combined CP-symmetry was proposed to maintain some semblance of universal
mirror-symmetry. However, in 1964 the Cronin-Fitch experiment discovered
CP-violation in the decays of particles known as neutral kaons[^4].

### What Now?
The discovery of CP-violation in the 1960s was devastating to the physics
community, not only because it demonstrated a universal preference for chirality,
but because of the numerous problems it suggested &mdash; problems that today
remain unsolved. Some of these open questions include

- Why does CP violation not occur in the strong force, even though the QCD Lagrangian permits it?
- How does CP violation give rise to the observed matter-antimatter imbalance in the universe?

These major questions have led to the undertaking of numerous experiments studying
decays of the B meson in hopes of understanding more:

- BaBar, SLAC National Accelerator Lab, California
- Belle/Belle II, KEKB/SuperKEKB, Japan
- LHCb, CERN, France/Switzerland
